## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run several commands:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code, and you'll see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

This command launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. More details can be found in the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section of the documentation.

### `npm run build`

Use this command to build the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. After building, your app is ready to be deployed. Additional information about deployment can be found in the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. This gives you full control over them and allows you to customize them as needed. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them as needed. This feature is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you are not obligated to use it, but it is available if you decide it is necessary.
